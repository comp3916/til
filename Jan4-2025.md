System prompts and user prompts serve different purposes when interacting with AI chat models:

### System Prompts
- **Purpose**: Define the AI's overall behavior, role, and constraints.
- **Usage**: Set by developers to establish the framework for how the AI should interact and respond.
- **Examples**:
  - **Behavioral Framing**: "You are a helpful assistant."
  - **Constraint Setting**: "Do not provide medical advice."
  - **Context Provision**: "You are assisting a user with technical support."
  - **Ethical Guidance**: "Always respect user privacy."

### User Prompts
- **Purpose**: Provide specific instructions or questions for a particular task or interaction.
- **Usage**: Given by users to elicit desired responses from the AI.
- **Examples**:
  - **Information Request**: "What is the weather like today?"
  - **Task Instruction**: "Generate a summary of this article."
  - **Creative Prompt**: "Write a short story about a dragon."

### Where to Use System Prompts
System prompts are typically used in the initial setup of an AI model to define its behavior and constraints. They are crucial for ensuring the AI operates within desired parameters and maintains consistency across interactions. For example, in a customer service chatbot, a system prompt might define the chatbot's tone as friendly and professional, and ensure it does not provide legal advice.

### Examples
1. **Customer Service Chatbot**:
   - **System Prompt**: "You are a customer service assistant. Always be polite and helpful. Do not provide legal or medical advice."
   - **User Prompt**: "How can I reset my password?"

2. **Educational Tutor**:
   - **System Prompt**: "You are an educational tutor specializing in mathematics. Provide clear and concise explanations."
   - **User Prompt**: "Can you explain the Pythagorean theorem?"
