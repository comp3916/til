**Capped ETF**, short for Exchange Traded Fund with a cap, is a type of ETF that invests in a specific set of securities, but limits the maximum amount it can invest in any single security or sector, regardless of its market capitalization. This cap is designed to manage concentration risk and ensure a diversified investment portfolio.

In the Canadian market, capped ETFs are a popular choice among investors looking for diversified exposure to Canadian stocks while avoiding excessive concentration in any particular sector or stock. Here are a few examples of capped ETFs from the Canadian market:

1. **iShares S&P/TSX Capped Financials Index ETF (XFN)**: This ETF tracks the S&P/TSX Capped Financials Index, which includes Canadian financial companies. The cap ensures that no more than 10% of the fund's assets can be allocated to any single security.

2. **iShares S&P/TSX Capped Energy Index ETF (XEG)**: This ETF tracks the S&P/TSX Capped Energy Index, providing exposure to Canadian energy companies. The cap limits the largest holding to 10% of the total assets, ensuring diversification.

3. **iShares S&P/TSX Capped Healthcare Index ETF (XHH)**: This ETF follows the S&P/TSX Capped Healthcare Index, offering exposure to Canadian healthcare companies. Like the other capped ETFs, it includes a cap to control concentration.

4. **Horizons Active Gold ETF (HUG)**: This ETF invests primarily in gold bullion and gold producers, with a cap on the allocation to any single gold producer to mitigate risk.

5. **BMO Equal Weight Canada Equity ETF (ZEC)**: While not explicitly capped by individual stock or sector, it employs an equal-weight strategy which inherently reduces the risk associated with overweighting any particular stock in the index.

Investing in capped ETFs can provide a more balanced and diversified exposure to specific sectors within the Canadian stock market, while safeguarding against the potential pitfalls of excessive concentration in a few securities. Always consider your investment objectives and risk tolerance before investing in any ETF. It's also advisable to consult with a financial advisor.

The **Law of Demeter** is a design principle in software development that aims to reduce coupling between objects and improve modularity. It is also known as the "Don't Talk to Strangers" principle.

The Law of Demeter states that an object should not talk to an object that it does not own or have a direct reference to. In other words, an object should only communicate with its immediate friends, and not with distant objects that it does not have a direct connection to.

This principle helps to:

* Reduce coupling between objects
* Improve modularity and reusability
* Simplify code and make it more maintainable

The Law of Demeter is often summarized as:

* An object should not know about the internal details of another object.
* An object should not talk to an object that it does not own or have a direct reference to.

By following the Law of Demeter, developers can create more modular, maintainable, and scalable software systems.
