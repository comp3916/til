In economics, a **free rider** refers to someone who benefits from a common good without contributing to its cost. This concept is often discussed within the framework of public goods, which are non-excludable (meaning no one can be effectively prevented from using the good) and non-rivalrous (one person's use does not reduce availability for others).

**Example 1: National Defense**

A classic example of a public good is national defense. The protection provided by a country's military shields all citizens, including those who do not pay their fair share of taxes. These individuals are free riders because they enjoy the benefits (safety and security) without contributing to the cost (through taxes).

**Example 2: Public Transportation**

Consider a city's public transportation system. It's a public good because once it's in place, anyone can use it, and one person's use doesn't diminish the availability for others. Some individuals may choose not to buy a transit pass but still use the buses or trains, thus benefiting from the service without contributing to its upkeep through fare payments or taxes.

**Example 3: Street Lighting**

Street lighting is another example of a public good. It benefits everyone by increasing safety at night, making it easier for people to walk or drive. However, some individuals may not pay for the electricity or maintenance of the lights but still enjoy the benefits of safer nighttime movement.

**Example 4: Environmental Protection**

Efforts to protect the environment, such as reducing carbon emissions, are also public goods. The benefits of a cleaner environment are shared by all, but the costs of such efforts can be borne by only a few individuals, companies, or countries that take the initiative. Others might continue to pollute without contributing to the solutions.

The free rider problem poses a challenge in the provision of public goods because there's an incentive for individuals to not contribute since they can still benefit from the good. This can lead to underproduction of such goods by the market, as private entities may not find it profitable to produce them without adequate compensation for their costs. Governments often step in to provide public goods through taxation, ensuring that everyone contributes to their provision.

The free rider problem is considered a problem even when all citizens contribute to taxes towards public goods like national defense, public transportation, street lighting, or environmental protection, because the concept hinges on the potential for disparity between individual contributions and perceived benefits. Here are a few reasons why it's still seen as a problem:

1. **Perceived Disparity**: Some individuals may feel that they are contributing more than they are benefiting. For instance, a person who rarely uses public transportation may resent paying taxes that go towards maintaining and expanding the system. Similarly, those who believe they have a lower risk of being targeted in a conflict may feel their taxes for national defense are excessive.

2. **Under-provision of Public Goods**: The free rider problem is particularly relevant when considering the **potential** for disparity between contributions and benefits, even if it's not perfectly realized in practice. The concern is that if too many individuals start to think like free riders, the collective will to fund public goods could diminish, leading to underinvestment and under-provision.

3. **Economic Efficiency**: Economically, the free rider problem shows that a market left to its own devices (without intervention) may not produce an optimal level of public goods. This is because the incentive for individuals to contribute voluntarily is weakened by the ability to enjoy the benefits without paying. This inefficiency can lead to a suboptimal allocation of resources.

4. **Equity Concerns**: The free rider problem also touches on issues of equity. If some individuals benefit disproportionately compared to their contributions, it can lead to a sense of unfairness. For instance, high-income earners might pay a higher share of taxes but may not use public services to the same extent as lower-income earners, raising questions of fairness.

5. **Incentives and Behavior**: Even when taxes are levied and collected broadly, the potential for individuals to act as free riders can affect behavior. For example, if people believe that others are not paying their fair share, they might be less willing to support additional public goods or higher levels of investment in existing ones.

In practice, governments often intervene to address these issues by setting tax policies that aim to equitably distribute the burden of funding public goods and by making public good provision as efficient and transparent as possible. Even with universal tax contributions, the theoretical possibility of free riding and its potential consequences make it a topic of continued interest and analysis in economics and public policy.

**Mindfulness** is a core concept in Buddhist teachings and practice, deeply embedded in the path to enlightenment and personal well-being. Mindfulness in Buddhism refers to the practice of cultivating a heightened state of awareness of one's thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations, and the surrounding environment, without judgment. This practice is rooted in the Pali term "sati" (सती), which means to remember, to be aware, or to be mindful.

### Foundations in Buddhist Teachings

**The Four Foundations of Mindfulness**: In the "Satipatthana Sutta," one of the most important discourses in the Pali Canon, the Buddha outlines the four foundations of mindfulness:

1. **Mindfulness of the body**: Paying attention to the body, its postures, movements, and sensations, without reacting.
2. **Mindfulness of feelings**: Observing emotions and sensations without clinging to pleasure or repulsion.
3. **Mindfulness of the mind**: Recognizing the nature of thoughts and mental processes without getting entangled in them.
4. **Mindfulness of mental objects**: Being aware of the content of consciousness, such as ideas, images, and perceptions.

**The Eightfold Path**: Mindfulness is part of the Buddha's Noble Eightfold Path, specifically the "Right Mindfulness" component. This path guides practitioners toward ethical conduct, wisdom, and mental discipline, with mindfulness as a key element in developing insight and reducing suffering.

### Practicing Mindfulness

**Meditation**: Mindfulness meditation is a primary tool for cultivating mindfulness. It involves sitting quietly, paying attention to the breath or bodily sensations, and gently returning the mind to the present moment when it wanders.

**Awareness in Daily Life**: Beyond formal meditation, mindfulness involves maintaining an alert and present awareness in daily activities. This includes eating, walking, talking, and even working, all with a sense of purpose and without being lost in thoughts.

**Non-judgmental Observation**: A crucial aspect of mindfulness is the practice of observing one's experiences without evaluating them as good or bad. This non-judgmental stance helps release the mental grip of likes and dislikes, fostering a more peaceful and balanced mind.

### Benefits and Impact

Mindfulness practice in Buddhism is aimed at reducing suffering and leading to enlightenment. The benefits extend to improved psychological well-being, including reduced stress, increased focus, and enhanced emotional regulation. Mindfulness encourages a deep understanding of the impermanent nature of existence, fostering greater contentment and peace.

In contemporary contexts, mindfulness has been adapted and secularized, becoming a popular tool for managing stress and improving mental health. However, its roots and philosophical depth remain anchored in Buddhist teachings, offering a comprehensive approach to understanding and transforming the mind.

Mindfulness and emotional intelligence (EI) are closely related concepts that both focus on understanding oneself and relating to others effectively. While they originate from different traditions—mindfulness from ancient spiritual practices, particularly Buddhism, and emotional intelligence from modern psychology—they intersect in their emphasis on self-awareness, self-regulation, and social awareness. Here's how they are related:

### Self-awareness

**Mindfulness**: Mindfulness involves becoming aware of one's thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations, and surrounding environment in the present moment, without judgment. Practicing mindfulness enhances self-awareness by allowing individuals to observe their internal experiences with clarity and equanimity.

**Emotional Intelligence**: EI includes self-awareness as one of its key components. It involves recognizing one's emotions, understanding their causes, and assessing their impact. Emotionally intelligent individuals are aware of their strengths and limitations, and they are able to articulate their feelings and drives.

### Self-regulation

**Mindfulness**: Mindfulness fosters self-regulation by encouraging a non-reactive stance towards one's thoughts and emotions. Through practices such as meditation, individuals learn to observe their reactions without automatically acting on them. This leads to improved impulse control and a greater ability to manage stress and emotions.

**Emotional Intelligence**: Self-regulation in EI involves controlling one's emotions and impulses, redirecting disruptive urges, and adapting to changing circumstances. Emotionally intelligent individuals can think before acting, manage their emotions in healthy ways, and align their actions with their goals and values.

### Social awareness

**Mindfulness**: While mindfulness primarily focuses on the individual's internal state, it lays the groundwork for social awareness by enhancing the ability to be present and engaged with others. Mindful communication involves listening actively and responding appropriately, which can aid in understanding others' perspectives and emotions.

**Emotional Intelligence**: Social awareness in EI encompasses the ability to understand and empathize with others, to pick up on social cues, and to recognize the power dynamics in relationships and groups. It involves treating others with compassion and respect, which are vital for effective teamwork and leadership.

### Conclusion

Mindfulness and emotional intelligence are mutually reinforcing. Practicing mindfulness can enhance one's emotional intelligence by developing the skills needed to understand and manage emotions, both one's own and those of others. Conversely, individuals with high emotional intelligence are often better able to apply mindfulness in their daily lives, as they are more adept at recognizing and responding to their emotions and those of others in a constructive manner. Together, they create a powerful synergy for personal growth, effective communication, and stronger relationships.

Mnemonic to explain them
**Precision** focuses on the accuracy of the model's positive predictions. It's like asking, "Out of all the things the model predicted to be positive, how many were actually positive?" 

**Recall** focuses on the model's ability to find all the actual positive cases. It's like asking, "Out of all the actual positive cases, how many did the model correctly identify?"

**Here's an analogy:**

Imagine you're searching for all the red marbles in a bag.

* **High Precision:** You only pick out marbles that are definitely red. You might miss some red marbles, but you're certain every marble you pick is red. 
* **High Recall:** You pick out all the red marbles, but you might also accidentally grab some other colors. You've found all the red ones, but your selection isn't perfectly pure.

**In essence:**

* **Precision** is about being correct when you say something is positive.
* **Recall** is about finding all the actual positive cases.

They both measure different aspects of a model's performance, and the ideal balance between them depends on the specific problem and its priorities.

Let's use a different analogy: Imagine you're a detective trying to find all the stolen jewels in a city.

* **High Precision:** You identify a few specific locations and confidently state that the jewels are definitely there. You might miss some hidden stashes, but you're certain about the locations you pinpoint. 

* **High Recall:** You cast a wide net, searching everywhere you can think of. You might find some non-jewel items in your search, but you're determined to find all the stolen jewels, no matter what.

**In essence:**

* **Precision** is about being accurate in your identifications (minimizing false alarms).
* **Recall** is about finding all the instances you're looking for (minimizing missed opportunities).

This analogy emphasizes that precision and recall represent different priorities. Sometimes, you need to be absolutely certain about your findings (high precision), while other times, it's more important to find everything, even if it means some false positives (high recall).
