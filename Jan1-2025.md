Tagged Template in JS
```
const person = "Mike";
const age = 28;

function myTag(strings, personExp, ageExp) {
  const str0 = strings[0]; // "That "
  const str1 = strings[1]; // " is a "
  const str2 = strings[2]; // "."

  const ageStr = ageExp < 100 ? "youngster" : "centenarian";

  // We can even return a string built using a template literal
  return `${str0}${personExp}${str1}${ageStr}${str2}`;
}

const output = myTag`That ${person} is a ${age}.`;

console.log(output);
// That Mike is a youngster.

In **Sapiens,** Harari challenges readers to reconsider what it means to be human. He argues that our success as a species is due to our ability to believe in fictions such as religions, nations, and money—concepts that are not inherent in the physical world but are shared collective imaginings that allow for cooperation on a large scale.

**Buckminster Fuller** was an American architect, systems theorist, author, designer, and inventor. He is best known for his work on the development of the geodesic dome, a type of structure based on a spherical or icosahedral shape that provides an efficient way to enclose space with minimal materials. The geodesic dome became a symbol of innovation and efficiency in architecture.

Fuller's contributions span beyond architecture into a wide range of fields including mathematics, engineering, and design. He coined the term "Spaceship Earth" to emphasize humanity's shared responsibility for preserving the planet. One of his most influential concepts was the idea of "comprehensive anticipatory design science," which aimed to solve global problems through holistic, anticipatory design that takes into account all relevant factors.

In addition to his architectural and design work, Fuller wrote several books and gave numerous lectures and speeches. His most famous book is "Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth," in which he explored his ideas on technology, society, and the future of humanity.

Fuller was known for his forward-thinking approach and his belief that humanity could solve its most pressing problems through the application of innovative design and technology. His legacy continues to inspire architects, designers, and thinkers to explore holistic, sustainable solutions to the challenges facing the world.


An endonym is a name for a geographical place, an ethnic group, a language, or a concept that is used natively within that group or place by its own inhabitants. It is the name they call themselves or their territory in their own language.

**Example of Endonym:**
The endonym for the country often referred to as "Germany" in English is "Deutschland" (pronounced "DOYCH-land"), which is the German name for the country.

A contrast with an exonym would be:

**Exonym:**
An exonym is a name for a geographical place, an ethnic group, a language, or a concept that is used outside of that group or place by other, often neighboring, cultures or nations. It is a foreign name for a place or a people.

**Example of Exonym:**
The exonym for the country called "Deutschland" (Germany) in English is "Germany," reflecting an external perspective and not the native name used within the country itself.

Endonyms can vary widely among different languages and often hold cultural significance. They are preferred in many international contexts as they respect the self-identity and linguistic heritage of the people or place in question. Exonyms, on the other hand, might have historical roots or reflect certain characteristics as observed by outsiders. In efforts toward more respectful and accurate terminology, many international organizations and geographic authorities encourage the use of endonyms.

**Sanātana Dharma** is a term that refers to the eternal, unchanging truth or the eternal law found in Hinduism. The term is composed of two Sanskrit words: "sanātana" (eternal, endless, perpetual) and "dharma" (duty, law, righteousness, truth). Sanātana Dharma is often interpreted as the eternal way or the eternal duty that all Hindus are expected to follow.

**Key aspects of Sanātana Dharma include:**

1. **Eternal Truth:** The concept suggests that the principles of dharma, or the eternal moral and spiritual laws, are inherent in the very fabric of reality and are not tied to a specific time, place, or person.

2. **Universal Harmony:** Sanātana Dharma emphasizes the pursuit of harmony among the individual, society, the natural world, and the cosmos. It is about living in a way that is in tune with these universal truths.

3. **Pluralism:** Unlike organized religions that typically emphasize a singular path, Sanātana Dharma acknowledges multiple paths (margas) to spiritual liberation (moksha). It encourages people to find the approach that resonates most with their nature and disposition.

4. **Philosophical Diversity:** Although Sanātana Dharma includes a vast array of philosophical and theological beliefs, it generally upholds the authority of the Vedas and Upanishads, and respects the importance of individual spiritual experience (anubhava) and realization (jñāna).

5. **Cyclical View:** Sanātana Dharma often embraces a cyclical view of time, where the universe undergoes periods of creation, preservation, dissolution, and renewal (Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva).

In practice, Sanātana Dharma encompasses a variety of rituals, traditions, social structures, philosophies, and scriptures, making Hinduism a richly diverse and multifaceted tradition. It is not a single creed but a complex and dynamic way of life that has evolved over thousands of years.
