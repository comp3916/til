**Teleology** is the philosophical concept that things have a purpose or predetermined goal. A simple example would be a key and a lock: the key is designed with the purpose of unlocking the lock. The key's teleology is the act of unlocking, which is its intended function. Similarly, in the natural world, a teleological perspective might view an acorn's purpose as becoming an oak tree, despite the acorn itself not having conscious intentions or goals.

**Valence** refers to the emotional tone or attractiveness of an event, object, or situation. It is a measure of how positive or negative an individual feels about something. Here's an example:

Imagine a person who has a strong positive valence towards chocolate. Whenever they see or think about chocolate, they experience positive emotions such as joy and satisfaction. On the other hand, if the same person has a negative valence towards broccoli, they may feel disgust or aversion when they see or think about broccoli.

Valence plays a key role in learning and motivation. Positively valenced stimuli tend to be approached, while negatively valenced stimuli are avoided. This helps organisms survive and thrive by guiding them towards beneficial experiences and away from harmful ones.
