First, King Lear himself has several monologues, especially when he's dealing with his daughters' betrayal and his descent into madness. There's the storm scene on the heath where he rages against the weather. Maybe he uses metaphors there. For example, he might compare the storm to his daughters' ingratitude. Wait, I think he does say something like that. Let me try to recall: "Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!" Is that a metaphor? Hmm, maybe personification of the winds. But perhaps the storm itself is a metaphor for the turmoil in his mind or the chaos in the kingdom.

Then there's the subplot with Gloucester and his sons, Edmund and Edgar. Gloucester's blinding might have some metaphorical references to sight and blindness, both literal and metaphorical. For example, when Gloucester says "I stumbled when I saw," after being blinded, that's a metaphor for his previous inability to see his sons' true natures. So the physical blindness represents his earlier metaphorical blindness.

Another character, Edgar, when he's disguised as Poor Tom, might use metaphors in his mad ramblings. Maybe references to animals or nature as metaphors for human behavior. For instance, when he talks about "hog in sloth, fox in stealth," etc., comparing vices to animals. That's a series of metaphors.

Also, Lear's speeches about justice and authority. Maybe when he talks about "a dog's obeyed in office," comparing authority figures to dogs, suggesting that power is what commands obedience, not the person's inherent worth. That's a metaphor.

Looking for specific quotes:

1. Lear's "Come not between the dragon and his wrath." Here, he compares himself to a dragon, a metaphor for his fierce, dangerous anger.

2. Gloucester's line about the gods killing us for their sport, which might be a metaphor for the randomness or cruelty of fate.

3. Lear's "How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child!" Comparing a thankless child to a serpent's tooth, implying the pain and venom of ingratitude.

4. The storm as a metaphor for Lear's inner turmoil and the kingdom's chaos.

5. Sight and blindness as metaphors for insight and ignorance. Gloucester's physical blindness after he gains insight into his sons' true natures.

6. Edgar's disguise as Poor Tom, which could be a metaphor for the stripping away of social status and pretense, revealing the bare human underneath.

Wait, but some of these might be symbols rather than metaphors. Let me check. A metaphor is a direct comparison, whereas a symbol is an object or action that represents something else. For example, the storm could be a symbol of chaos, but when Lear addresses the storm as if it's a person or compares his situation to the storm's fury, that's metaphor.

Also, when Lear says "I am a man more sinned against than sinning," is that a metaphor? Not exactly; it's a statement. But when he talks about being bound "upon a wheel of fire," that's a metaphor for his torment.

Another example: Kent's description of Oswald as a "glass-gazing" servant, implying he's vain, like someone who looks in mirrors all the time. That's a metaphor.

Or when Lear divides the kingdom, he uses the metaphor of a map to represent the division of his power and land among his daughters.

Wait, the map itself is a literal object, but the act of dividing it is symbolic. Maybe not a metaphor. Hmm.

I need to make sure the examples are actual metaphors. Let me think of more direct comparisons. For instance, when Lear says "We two alone will sing like birds i' the cage," in Act 5, he's using a metaphor comparing himself and Cordelia to caged birds, symbolizing their captivity but also their companionship.

Also, the Fool often uses metaphorical language. For example, when he says "Thou hast pared thy wit o' both sides and left nothing i' the middle," comparing Lear's loss of wisdom to paring something down to nothing.

Another one: "Truth's a dog must to kennel; he must be whipped out." Here, the Fool compares truth to a dog that's banished, a metaphor for how honesty is punished in Lear's court.

So compiling these, the key metaphors are:

1. Dragon (Lear as a dragon)

2. Serpent's tooth (thankless child)

3. Storm as internal turmoil

4. Wheel of fire (torment)

5. Caged birds (Lear and Cordelia)

6. Truth as a dog

7. Blindness vs. sight

8. Animals representing vices (Edgar's speech)

I need to verify these and find the exact quotes. Let me check each one.

1. "Come not between the dragon and his wrath." Act 1, Scene 1. Lear is referring to himself as a dragon, metaphor.

2. "How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child!" Act 1, Scene 4. Comparing the pain of a thankless child to a serpent's bite.

3. The storm scenes in Act 3. Lear says, "Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow! / You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout..." Here, he's addressing the storm, but the storm itself serves as a metaphor for his inner chaos.

4. "Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia, / The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee? / He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven, / And fire us hence like foxes." (Act 5, Scene 3). Comparing their separation to foxes being driven out by fire. Wait, that's a simile. Hmm.

Wait, "wheel of fire" comes from another play, maybe? Let me think. Oh, in King Lear, Lear says, "But I am bound upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears do scald like molten lead." Act 4, Scene 7. Here, he's using a metaphor to describe his torment as being bound to a wheel that's on fire.

5. "We two alone will sing like birds i' the cage." Act 5, Scene 3. Simile again with "like," but the idea of being caged birds is a metaphor for their situation.

6. The Fool's line: "Truth's a dog must to kennel; he must be whipped out." Act 1, Scene 4. Metaphor comparing truth to a dog.

7. Gloucester's lines about blindness: "I have no way and therefore want no eyes; / I stumbled when I saw." Act 4, Scene 1. The metaphor here is that physical blindness represents his previous inability to see the truth.

8. Edgar as Poor Tom: "hog in sloth, fox in stealth, wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in prey." Act 3, Scene 4. Each animal metaphorically represents a vice.

Okay, that seems like a good list. I need to make sure these are all from King Lear and correctly cited. Some might need exact quotes and act/scene references. Also, ensure they are metaphors and not similes or symbols. For example, "serpent's tooth" is a simile because of "sharper than," but the thankless child is compared to the serpent's tooth, so maybe it's a metaphor. Wait, the full quote is "How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child!" So it's saying the pain is sharper than a serpent's tooth, which is a simile. Hmm, maybe that's a simile, not a metaphor. So I need to be careful.

So revising:

The "dragon" metaphor is a direct metaphor: Lear is the dragon.

The storm as a metaphor for internal turmoil.

The "wheel of fire" as a metaphor for torment.

Truth as a dog.

Blindness as a metaphor for insight.

Edgar's animal metaphors for vices.

"Serpent's tooth" is a simile, so maybe not. Similarly, "sing like birds" is a simile.

So focusing on direct metaphors where something is stated as another thing without "like" or "as."

Another example: In Act 4, Scene 6, Lear says, "A man may see how this world goes with no eyes. Look with thine ears." Here, seeing with ears is a metaphor for understanding through means other than sight.

Also, when Lear refers to Goneril and Regan as "pelican daughters," alluding to the myth that pelicans feed on their parents' blood, which is a metaphor for their betrayal.

Wait, but "pelican daughters" is a direct metaphor, comparing them to pelicans in that context.

Another one: In Act 3, Scene 2, Lear says, "I am a man more sinned against than sinning." Not a metaphor, but a statement.



### 1. **"Come not between the dragon and his wrath."**  
   - **Act 1, Scene 1**: Lear compares himself to a "dragon," symbolizing his fierce, destructive anger. This metaphor underscores his unchecked power and the danger of confronting him.

### 2. **The Storm as Inner Turmoil**  
   - **Act 3, Scenes 2-4**: The raging storm on the heath mirrors Lear’s mental chaos and the political disarray of the kingdom. Lear’s cry, *"Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks!"* personifies the storm, but the tempest itself serves as a metaphor for his fractured psyche.

### 3. **Blindness and Insight**  
   - **Gloucester**: *"I stumbled when I saw."* (**Act 4, Scene 1**). After being blinded, Gloucester metaphorically "sees" the truth about his sons. Physical blindness represents his newfound moral clarity.

### 4. **"Truth’s a dog must to kennel."**  
   - **Act 1, Scene 4**: The Fool compares truth to a banished dog, highlighting how honesty is punished in Lear’s court. This metaphor critiques the corruption of power.

### 5. **Animal Vices**  
   - **Edgar as Poor Tom**: *"hog in sloth, fox in stealth, wolf in greediness..."* (**Act 3, Scene 4**). Each animal metaphorically represents human sins, illustrating societal decay.

### 6. **"Look with thine ears."**  
   - **Act 4, Scene 6**: Lear advises Gloucester to perceive the world through listening, not sight. This metaphor emphasizes understanding beyond superficial appearances.

### 7. **"Pelican Daughters"**  
   - **Act 3, Scene 4**: Lear calls Goneril and Regan "pelican daughters," referencing the myth of pelicans feeding on parental blood. This metaphor condemns their betrayal and ingratitude.

### 8. **"Bound upon a wheel of fire."**  
   - **Act 4, Scene 7**: Lear describes his suffering as being tied to a burning wheel, a metaphor for unending torment and guilt over Cordelia’s fate.

These metaphors enrich the play’s exploration of power, betrayal, and human folly, demonstrating Shakespeare’s mastery of figurative language.
