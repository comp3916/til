**Summary of CSDM 4.0 Draft White Paper:**

The **Common Service Data Model (CSDM) 4.0** is a ServiceNow framework that standardizes service-related definitions and data modeling within the CMDB. It provides prescriptive guidance to align ServiceNow products and enable consistent reporting, automation, and scalability. Below are the key points:

---

### **1. Core Purpose of CSDM**
- **Standardization**: Establishes a shared data model across ServiceNow products for service-level reporting and CMDB consistency.
- **CMDB Framework**: Guides how data should be structured in the CMDB using out-of-box (OOB) tables and relationships.
- **Not a Product**: CSDM is a blueprint, not a purchasable module. All required tables are included OOB.

### **2. Key Components**
#### **Domains**
CSDM organizes data into **5 domains**:
1. **Foundation**: Base referential data (e.g., Business Process, Contracts, Locations, Groups, Users, Product Models).
2. **Design**: Planning and architecture (e.g., Business Capabilities, Business Applications, Information Objects).
3. **Build**: Development lifecycle (e.g., SDLC Components for DevOps).
4. **Manage Technical Services**: Operational IT services (e.g., Application Services, Technical Services, Dynamic CI Groups).
5. **Sell/Consume**: Business-facing services (e.g., Business Services, Service Portfolio, Request Catalog).

#### **Service Types**
- **Application Service**: Logical representation of deployed systems (e.g., `cmdb_ci_service_auto`).
- **Business Service**: Supports business capabilities (e.g., `cmdb_ci_service_business`).
- **Technical Service**: Underpins business/application services (e.g., `cmdb_ci_service_technical`).

### **3. Key Principles**
1. Simplified concepts and prescriptive relationships.
2. Designed for reporting/analytics and shared collaboration.
3. OOB tables and consistent data integrations.
4. Governance and lifecycle management (e.g., Life Cycle Stages/Statuses for Products, Hardware, Locations).

---

### **4. Implementation Approach**
Adopt CSDM in stages:
1. **Foundation**: Focus on referential data (Company, Business Unit, Locations, Product Models).
2. **Crawl**: Add operational CIs (Application Services, Business Applications).
3. **Walk**: Introduce Technical Services and Dynamic CI Groups.
4. **Run**: Integrate Business Services and Offerings for impact analysis.
5. **Fly**: Finalize with Business Capabilities, Information Objects, and Request Catalog integration.

---

### **5. New in CSDM 4.0**
- **Expanded Domains**: Addition of the **Build Domain** (SDLC Components) and enhanced **Sell/Consume Domain**.
- **Lifecycle Management**: Unified Life Cycle Stages/Statuses for Products, Hardware, Documents, and Locations.
- **Location Management**: Hierarchical attributes (Region, Country, Site, etc.) and duplicate validation.
- **Dynamic CI Groups**: Query-based groupings for automation (e.g., patch management, service mapping).

---

### **6. Migration Guidance**
- **Steps**: Backup data, map attributes, identify dependencies, refactor customizations, and migrate CIs.
- **Tools**: Use the **CMDB and CSDM Data Foundations Dashboard** (App Store) and dependency scripts to streamline migration.

---

### **7. Value Proposition**
- **ITSM/ITOM**: Improved incident, problem, and change management through clear service relationships.
- **Scalability**: Supports future products (e.g., APM, SPM, DevOps) by ensuring data alignment.
- **Digital Transformation**: Acts as a foundation for integrating IT and business services on the Now Platform.

---

**Conclusion**: CSDM 4.0 provides a structured, prescriptive approach to service modeling, enabling organizations to maximize ServiceNowâ€™s value through standardized data, automation, and cross-product alignment. Adopting it in stages ensures manageable implementation while laying the groundwork for advanced analytics and governance.
