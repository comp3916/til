A pseudo-element in CSS is a keyword added to a selector that allows you to style specific parts of an element without having to add extra HTML markup. Think of it as a way to create virtual elements within an existing one.

For example, `::before` and `::after` are commonly used pseudo-elements that let you insert content before or after an element.

Here's a simple example:

```css
p::before {
  content: "ðŸŒŸ ";
  color: gold;
}

p::after {
  content: " âœ¨";
  color: lightblue;
}
```

This code adds a gold star before every `<p>` paragraph and a sparkle after itâ€”without modifying the HTML.
