Microsoft Endpoint Manager and Microsoft Intune are closely related but serve different roles within the same ecosystem.

### **Microsoft Endpoint Manager**
Microsoft Endpoint Manager is a comprehensive suite of tools designed to help organizations manage and secure their devices and applications. It includes several components, such as:

- **Microsoft Intune**: A cloud-based service for mobile device management (MDM) and mobile application management (MAM).
- **Configuration Manager**: An on-premises management solution for desktops, servers, and laptops.
- **Co-management**: Allows you to manage devices with both Configuration Manager and Intune.
- **Endpoint Analytics**: Provides insights to improve user productivity and reduce IT support costs.
- **Windows Autopilot**: Simplifies the deployment of new Windows devices[1](https://atech.cloud/resources/whats-the-difference-between-microsoft-endpoint-manager-and-intune/)[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/endpoint-manager-overview).

### **Microsoft Intune**
Microsoft Intune is a part of the Endpoint Manager suite and focuses specifically on cloud-based MDM and MAM. It allows organizations to:

- Manage devices and applications from the cloud.
- Enforce security policies and compliance requirements.
- Deploy and update applications across various devices, including Android, iOS, Windows, and macOS.
- Provide a self-service portal for users to resolve common issues[1](https://atech.cloud/resources/whats-the-difference-between-microsoft-endpoint-manager-and-intune/)[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/endpoint-manager-overview).

### **Use Cases**
- **Endpoint Manager**: Ideal for organizations needing a unified solution to manage both cloud and on-premises environments. It is suitable for hybrid work environments where devices need to be managed both remotely and on-site.
- **Intune**: Best for organizations looking to manage mobile devices and applications from the cloud. It is particularly useful for enforcing security policies, managing app deployments, and supporting bring-your-own-device (BYOD) scenarios[1](https://atech.cloud/resources/whats-the-difference-between-microsoft-endpoint-manager-and-intune/)[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/endpoint-manager-overview).

In summary, while Microsoft Endpoint Manager is a broader suite that includes various tools for device and application management, Microsoft Intune is a specific component within this suite focused on cloud-based management.

If your organization has a footprint both on-premises and in the cloud, **Microsoft Endpoint Manager** would be sufficient because it includes **Microsoft Intune** as part of its suite. Here's how it works:

- **Endpoint Manager** integrates both **Configuration Manager** (for on-premises management) and **Intune** (for cloud-based management).
- This integration allows you to manage all your devices, whether they are on-premises or in the cloud, from a single platform.
- You can use **co-management** to manage devices with both Configuration Manager and Intune, providing flexibility and ensuring that you can leverage the strengths of both environments.

In essence, by using Microsoft Endpoint Manager, you get the benefits of both on-premises and cloud management without needing to deploy separate solutions. This unified approach simplifies management and enhances security across your entire device ecosystem.
