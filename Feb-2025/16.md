## Correlation Ids in APIM

Configure the global policy, so it affects all API calls.  This inbound policy performs the following actions:

Take the consumer-provided correlation-id from the x-correlation-id HTTP header or generate a new guid if none is provided
Set the correlation id in the HTTP header for downstream traceability
Log the correlation id with a descriptive context to App Insights via the Trace policy
<!--Use consumer correlation id or generate new one-->
<set-variable name="correlation-id" value="@(context.Request.Headers.GetValueOrDefault("x-correlation-id", Guid.NewGuid().ToString()))"/>
<!--Set header for end-to-end correlation-->
<set-header name="x-correlation-id" exists-action="override">
   <value>@((string)context.Variables["correlation-id"])</value>
</set-header>
<!--Trace the correlation id-->
<trace source="Global APIM Policy" severity="information">
   <message>@(String.Format("{0} | {1}", context.Api.Name, context.Operation.Name))</message>
   <metadata name="correlation-id" value="@((string)context.Variables["correlation-id"])"/>
</trace>
With this simple outbound policy, we return the correlation id, so it can be used for troubleshooting.

<!--Set header for end-to-end correlation-->
<set-header name="x-correlation-id" exists-action="override">
   <value>@((string)context.Variables["correlation-id"])</value>
</set-header>

**Cultural Relativism** is an anthropological concept that emphasizes the importance of understanding a culture on its own terms, rather than judging it based on the standards of another culture. This approach recognizes that cultural norms, values, and practices are relative to the specific cultural context and should be evaluated in relation to that context, rather than being judged as right or wrong based on universal standards.

Cultural relativism encourages researchers and observers to:

* Avoid imposing their own cultural values on other cultures
* Recognize the diversity and complexity of human cultures
* Focus on understanding the cultural context and meaning behind practices and behaviors
* Be aware of their own cultural biases and assumptions

For example, what may be considered a taboo or unacceptable behavior in one culture may be considered a normal part of life in another culture. Cultural relativism helps us to approach these differences with an open mind and to avoid making value judgments based on our own cultural background.
