Working on a project that requires validating JWT Claims at the APIM. Some notes below for future reference

If you need to provide the key in the JWT policy, but this is unnecessary if the correct openid-configuration endpoint is provided, as this would be automatically done by the policy

It is required to base64 encode the signing key (Info from SO - capturing for easy future access here)

Here is the link to the tool used in the above screenshot
[Test JWT Generator](http://jwtbuilder.jamiekurtz.com/)

Supporting multiple Identity providers
```
<set-variable 
   name="iss" 
   value="@(context.Request.Headers.GetValueOrDefault("Authorization", "")?.Split(' ')?.ElementAtOrDefault(1)?.AsJwt()?.Claims["iss"]?.FirstOrDefault() ?? "")" 
/>
<choose>
    <when condition="@(context.Variables.GetValueOrDefault("iss", "").Equals("myIssuer.com"))">
       <validate-jwt configuration1... />
    </when>
    <otherwise>
       <validate-jwt configuration2... />
    </otherwise>
</choose>
```

Another approach is to leverage different headers to qualify the target IDP

```
<choose>
    <when condition="@(context.Request.Headers.GetValueOrDefault("X-ProductCode","") == "XYZ")">
        <validate-jwt header-name="Authorization" failed-validation-httpcode="401" failed-validation-error-message="Unauthorized" require-expiration-time="true" require-signed-tokens="true">
            <openid-config url="https://xyz.au.auth0.com/.well-known/openid-configuration" />
            <audiences>
                <audience>xyz-audience1</audience>
            </audiences>
        </validate-jwt>
    </when>
    <when condition="@(context.Request.Headers.GetValueOrDefault("X-ProductCode","") == "ABC")">
        <validate-jwt header-name="Authorization" failed-validation-httpcode="401" failed-validation-error-message="Unauthorized" require-expiration-time="true" require-signed-tokens="true">
            <openid-config url="https://abc.au.auth0.com/.well-known/openid-configuration" />
            <audiences>
                <audience>abc-audience1</audience>
                <audience>abc-audience2</audience>
            </audiences>
        </validate-jwt>
    </when>
</choose>
```

**Trading at Market Multiple**: This phrase refers to a trading strategy where an investor buys or sells a security at the current market price, which is the price at which the security is trading at the time of the transaction.

For example, let's say a stock is trading at $50 per share, and an investor wants to buy 100 shares of that stock. If the investor buys 100 shares at the current market price of $50, they are trading at the market multiple of 1.0, because the price they paid per share ($50) is equal to the current market price.

```text
Market Price: $50 per share
Number of Shares: 100
Total Cost: 100 x $50 = $5,000
Market Multiple: 1.0 (since $50 = $50)
```

In this example, the investor is not trying to buy the stock at a discount or a premium to the market price. They are simply buying the stock at the current market price, which is $50 per share.


**Trading at Book Value**: Trading at book value means buying or selling a security at a price that is equal to its book value, which is the net asset value of the security as recorded on the company's balance sheet.

Book value is calculated by subtracting liabilities from assets, and it represents the amount that would be left over if the company were to liquidate its assets and pay off its debts.

For example, let's say a company has the following balance sheet:

* Assets: $100,000
* Liabilities: $80,000
* Book Value: $100,000 - $80,000 = $20,000 per share (assuming 5,000 shares outstanding)

If the company's stock is trading at $20 per share, it means that investors are buying the stock at the exact same price as its book value. In this case, the market multiple would be 1.0, because the price per share ($20) is equal to the book value per share ($20).

```text
Book Value: $20,000 per share
Number of Shares: 5,000
Market Price: $20 per share
Market Multiple: 1.0 (since $20 = $20)
```

Trading at book value suggests that investors believe the company's stock is worth exactly what its assets are worth, minus its liabilities.
