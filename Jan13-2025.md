**The Banality of Evil**: a concept introduced by philosopher Hannah Arendt in her book "Eichmann in Jerusalem" (1963). It describes how ordinary, everyday people can commit heinous acts, such as genocide, without displaying any obvious signs of evil or malevolence.

> The term "banality of evil" suggests that evil can be perpetrated by individuals who are not necessarily driven by a desire to do evil, but rather by a desire to conform to societal norms, follow orders, or take advantage of situations.

Arendt argued that the Nazi official Adolf Eichmann, who was responsible for organizing the logistics of the Holocaust, was not a charismatic or overtly evil figure, but rather a bureaucratic and unremarkable individual who carried out his duties without questioning their morality.

This concept challenges the traditional notion of evil as something extraordinary or extraordinary, and instead highlights the importance of considering the social and psychological factors that contribute to human behavior, even in the face of atrocities.
