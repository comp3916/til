Here are some terms I came across in my readings today

**At-will employment** is a legal concept in the United States that allows employers to terminate an employee's contract at any time, for any reason, or for no reason at all, without facing liability for wrongful termination. This means that an employee can be fired without cause, and the employer is not required to provide a specific reason for the termination.

In an at-will employment arrangement:

* **Employers have discretion**: Employers can hire, fire, promote, demote, or discipline employees as they see fit.
* **Employees have limited protection**: Employees are generally not entitled to a reason for their termination, and they may not be able to sue the employer for wrongful termination.
* **No contract term**: There is no minimum term or contract duration, and the employment relationship can be terminated at any time.

However, there are some exceptions to at-will employment, such as:

* **Implied contract**: An implied contract can arise when an employer makes promises or representations to an employee that suggest a longer-term employment relationship.
* **Public policy**: Certain laws, such as those related to whistleblowing or discrimination, may limit an employer's ability to terminate an employee.
* **Collective bargaining agreements**: Employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement may have greater protections and limitations on at-will employment.

**Johannine Jesus** refers to the depiction of Jesus Christ in the Gospel of John, which is one of the four canonical Gospels in the New Testament of the Bible. The Gospel of John is attributed to the Apostle John, who is believed to have written it around 90-110 AD.

In the Johannine Gospel, Jesus is portrayed as a divine being, with a unique and distinct character. Some key features of Johannine Jesus include:

* **Divine equality**: Jesus is depicted as equal to God the Father, with the same divine nature and attributes.
* **Pre-existence**: Jesus is said to have existed before his birth, and is believed to have been present at creation.
* **Spiritual emphasis**: The Johannine Gospel places a strong emphasis on the spiritual nature of Jesus' teachings and ministry, with a focus on faith, love, and eternal life.
* **Miracles and signs**: Jesus is depicted as performing many miracles and signs, which are seen as evidence of his divine authority.

The Johannine Jesus is often contrasted with the more humanized and earthy depiction of Jesus in the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke). The Johannine Jesus is seen as more abstract and mystical, with a greater emphasis on his divine nature and spiritual teachings.


**Croesus** was a king of the ancient Kingdom of Lydia, which existed in modern-day western Turkey from the 7th to the 6th century BC. He is best known for his vast wealth and his encounter with the Greek philosopher Solon.

Croesus was a wealthy and powerful ruler who had a reputation for being extremely wealthy, with some estimates suggesting that his wealth was worth over $200 billion in modern-day terms. He was known for his extravagant lifestyle and his love of luxury.

According to legend, Croesus consulted the Oracle of Delphi to determine the outcome of a war he was planning to wage against the Persian Empire. The Oracle replied that if Croesus went to war, he would "destroy a great empire." Croesus interpreted this as a sign that he would emerge victorious, but in fact, the Oracle was referring to the destruction of his own empire, which was eventually conquered by the Persians.

The phrase "rich as Croesus" has become a common expression to describe someone who is extremely wealthy.


A **horseshoe issue** is a term used in politics and social debate to describe a situation where two opposing groups or individuals are so entrenched in their opposing views that they become mirror images of each other, with each side adopting extreme or radical positions.

The term "horseshoe theory" was coined by the American political scientist and commentator William F. Buckley Jr. in the 1950s. It suggests that when two opposing groups are deeply divided, they often become polarized to the point where they converge on a single point, with each side adopting an extreme position.

In a horseshoe issue, the two opposing groups may become so extreme that they begin to resemble each other, with each side adopting a "horseshoe" shape, where the two ends of the spectrum converge.

For example, in a debate over gun control, one side may advocate for extreme gun restrictions, while the other side advocates for extreme gun rights. In a horseshoe issue, each side becomes so entrenched in their opposing views that they become mirror images of each other, with each side adopting an extreme position.

The horseshoe theory suggests that this type of polarization can lead to a breakdown in civil discourse and a failure to find common ground, as each side becomes more entrenched in their opposing views.


**Julius Evola** (1898-1974) was an Italian philosopher, occultist, and esoteric writer. He is considered one of the most important and influential thinkers of the 20th century, and his work has had a significant impact on various fields, including philosophy, politics, and spirituality.

**Ephemera** refers to items that are transitory or fleeting in nature, often lasting for a short period of time. These items can be physical objects, documents, or even digital content that is impermanent or temporary.

Examples of ephemera include:

* **Digital content**: Social media posts, emails, or online articles that are temporary and may be deleted or lost over time.

The term "ephemera" comes from the Greek word "ephemeros," which means "lasting for a day." Ephemera can be a fascinating topic for historians, collectors, and researchers, as they provide a glimpse into the past and can be used to understand the culture and society of a particular time and place.

In addition to its literal meaning, the term "ephemera" can also be used metaphorically to describe things that are transitory or fleeting in nature, such as:

* **Memories**: Memories that are fleeting and can be lost over time.
* **Emotions**: Emotions that are temporary and can change quickly.
* **Opportunities**: Opportunities that are temporary and can be lost if not seized.

Overall, ephemera can be a powerful tool for understanding the past and the present, and can provide insights into the human experience.
