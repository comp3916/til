A **pincer move** is a military tactic where two forces, often from opposite sides of an enemy position, converge on it simultaneously, encircling and trapping the enemy. This tactic is often used to surround and defeat an enemy unit or to capture key terrain. The pincer move can be effective in various contexts, including warfare, sports, and even business strategies.


The **convexity effect** refers to the relationship between the change in an asset's price and the change in its duration or yield. In simpler terms, it measures how much the duration of an asset changes when the yield changes. Convexity is an important concept in fixed income investing, particularly for bonds and other interest-rate sensitive securities.

**Key points:**

* Convexity is a measure of how much an asset's duration changes when the yield changes.
* High convexity assets tend to benefit from rising interest rates, while low convexity assets tend to suffer.
* Convexity can be positive or negative, depending on the type of asset and market conditions.

In the context of the convexity effect, **yield** refers to the return or income generated by an asset, such as a bond. It's typically expressed as a percentage and represents the annual return on investment.

For example, let's consider a 10-year government bond with a face value of $1,000 and a coupon rate of 5%. The bond pays an annual interest of 5% ($50) and matures at par value ($1,000).

* **Yield** in this case is 5%, which represents the annual return on investment.
* **Duration**, a related concept, measures the bond's sensitivity to changes in interest rates. A longer duration bond is more sensitive to changes in interest rates.

Now, let's consider what happens if interest rates rise to 6%. The bond's price would likely fall, reducing its duration. However, the bond's yield would increase to 6%, providing a higher return on investment.

In this example, the bond's **convexity** would be positive, meaning that its duration decreases as interest rates rise, and its yield increases. This is a desirable trait for investors, as it allows them to benefit from rising interest rates.

Yes, a bond's **yield** can change over its lifetime, particularly for long-term bonds. This is because bond yields are influenced by market conditions, economic factors, and interest rate changes.

Let's consider a 20-year corporate bond with the following characteristics:

| Year | Face Value | Coupon Rate | Yield to Maturity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2025 | $1,000 | 6% | 6.2% |
| 2035 | $1,000 | 6% | 4.8% |
| 2045 | $1,000 | 6% | 5.1% |

In this example, the bond's face value, coupon rate, and maturity date remain the same throughout its lifetime. However, the **yield to maturity** (YTM) changes over time due to changes in market conditions and interest rates.

* In 2025, the bond's YTM is 6.2%, reflecting a relatively high interest rate environment.
* By 2035, the interest rate environment has changed, and the bond's YTM drops to 4.8%. This is because the bond's price has increased, making it less attractive to investors.
* In 2045, the bond's YTM rises to 5.1% as the interest rate environment changes again.

This example illustrates how a bond's yield can change over its lifetime, reflecting changes in market conditions and interest rates.

## Fabric Notes
Workspace identity in Microsoft Fabric is a feature that allows workspaces to securely access external resources, such as Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 accounts, without exposing credentials[1]. This identity is associated with Fabric workspaces that are linked to a Fabric F SKU capacity[1].

Key aspects and use cases of workspace identity include:

1. Secure data access: Workspace identities can access Azure Data Lake Gen 2 accounts with public network access enabled, but only from selected virtual networks and IP addresses[1].

2. Granular control: Organizations can limit ADLS Gen 2 access to specific Fabric workspaces, enhancing security and data governance[1].

3. Trusted workspace access: This feature enables secure connections to data sources without exposing them to public networks or requiring complex network configurations[1].

4. Simplified authentication: Workspace identity eliminates the need for managing and storing separate credentials for each data source, as the workspace itself is authenticated[1].

5. Compliance and governance: By using workspace identities, organizations can better control and audit data access, aligning with security policies and compliance requirements[1].

It's important to note that workspace identities are only available in workspaces associated with a Fabric F SKU capacity, which requires a specific Fabric subscription[1]. This feature is particularly useful for organizations that need to maintain strict control over data access while leveraging the power of Microsoft Fabric for data analytics and management.

Yes, a Microsoft Fabric workspace can access data stored in an Azure blob storage that doesn't have public access enabled and is only accessible via a VNET. This can be achieved through the use of managed private endpoints in Fabric. Here's how you can enable this access:

1. Managed Private Endpoints: Fabric provides managed private endpoints that allow secure connections to data sources like Azure blob storage without exposing them to the public network[1].

2. Managed Virtual Networks: Each Fabric workspace is associated with a managed virtual network, which provides network isolation for Fabric Spark workloads[1].

To enable access:

1. Create a managed private endpoint in your Fabric workspace that points to your Azure blob storage account.

2. Configure the Azure blob storage account to accept connections from the managed private endpoint.

3. Once the connection is approved and established, your Fabric workspace can securely access the data in the blob storage through the private endpoint, without the need for public access.

This approach ensures that your data remains secure within your virtual network while still allowing Fabric to access and analyze it. It eliminates the need for complex network configurations or exposing your storage to public networks[1].


## Literary terms
A good collection of [literary terms explained](https://liberalarts.oregonstate.edu/wlf/oregon-state-guide-english-literary-terms)

The following terms were new to me
- Zeugma
- [Synecdoche ](https://liberalarts.oregonstate.edu/wlf/what-synecdoche)

> Metaphor, metonymy, and synecdoche are all kinds of figurative language that use one thing to help us understand something else. A metonym, as you know, replaces something you want to characterize with something else associated with it. A synecdoche is a kind of metonym, but the associated thing is actually a component part, a piece, of whatever you are characterizing. When we talk about getting “boots on the ground,” we’re using a synecdoche: by boots, we mean soldiers. But boots are part of the soldiers (at least when they are dressed), so this expression is really a synecdoche rather than just a metonym. The super-classic example of synecdoche, that you’ll find on every website, is “fifty keels plowed the deep.” Fifty ships sailing on the ocean are represented by their keels, a component part of the vessel thus standing for the whole.

> The poet Allen Ginsberg was a great lover of synecdoche. Two examples are afforded by his poem “A Supermarket in California,” and understanding these examples helps us interpret Ginsberg’s themes. In the poem, the narrator fantasizes about following the nineteenth-century poet Walt Whitman around a mid twentieth-century grocery story. He overhears Whitman ask the grocer, in the meat section, “who killed the pork chops?”  That’s a synecdoche – it was of course the pig, not the pork chop, that was killed; the pork chop is the fragmented part that stands for the whole.
